Da questo case study dovrebbe emergere
- come affronto i problemi
- come ho risolto il caso specifico
- cosa sono in grado di offrire ad un cliente, in termini di servizi
- come prendo a cuore gli obiettivi del cliente realizzando la soluzione più consona al caso (in questo caso, scarsa configurazione e abilità tecnica necessaria, rete locale perché no copertura internet, basso costo di materiale)

# Restaurant Management Tool

RMT (Restaurant Management Tool) is a software solution I built which aims at simplifying the tasks that waiters, chefs and managers need to complete when running a restaurant. It started as a client job, but it is now continuing to grow and new features keep being added as the first adopters of the product go on sharing their ideas and needs; as of now, RMT allows you to collect orders at the tables, print the orders at different locations of the restaurant (e.g. - at the bar and at the kitchen), gather statistics on the business' sales trends.

## The problem and the client

*"Ok here's the thing: I run a local restaurant a couple of blocks away from here and, honestly, we're sinking. The staff counts too few people to manage all the aspects involved, and I can't hire anyone else for the time being. We need a solution - and we need it quickly -, like some automatic system allowing us to reduce the unbearable amount of manual and repetitive work that we've got to sustain. Do you think you can help with that?"*.

Sure thing I do. Of course this isn't exactly how it went, however we still respect the actual scenario: we've got a client who is experiencing some tough problems in managing and keeping alive her own restaurant. The first thing that I came to realize after listening to her story was the fact that, not only this business needs to simplify the whole process, from when the customers step in, to when they pay the bill and walk away, but, surprisingly, she decided to invest on a system that could allow the staff to be faster in doing what they already do. This is not a minor component of the story at all, in fact, this immediately implies that we put a major effort in crafting the smoothest experience possible while brainstorming for as many helpful features as we could , so to allow waiters and chefs to do more work, without the need for an expensive and time-consuming hiring campaign.

## Our process to tackle the problem

In this piece I want to highlight how we went about analysing and framing the problem, showing our process when it comes to designing the perfect solution for our clients. One that correctly aligns with their needs, their goals and, as in this case, one that helps mitigating their struggles.

### Identifying the pain points

As for every problem, I start by focusing on the pain points the client is experiencing in her life, which ultimately led her to me; by doing this, I am in the right position to align with my client's goals, frame the problem at hand, and design the perfect solution.
I sat with the restaurant owner and talked through her process, investigating on what the staff's needs are and how they strive to offer the best experience to their customers.
I went on framing the main components of the scenario, better defining the following points:
 - **the users of the service**: those would be members of the staff itself, plus the very restaurant owner who is the chef as well
 - **why she believes she needs an automatic system**: there isn't a single answer here, the main reason is they are currently experiencing so many problems due to human error and manual intervention
 - **the major pain points she wishes to address**: here it comes a long list, including too many mistakes, too much stuff to keep in mind at once, too slow to calculate the bills, increasing difficulty in handling daily and monthly revenue totals, too slow to take to orders, too much miscommunication between the waiters and the kitchen in transmitting the orders, complexity of keeping two separate copies of the orders (one for the bar, one for the kitchen)


## Building the solution

Problema:
Troppo intervento manuale, errori e lentezza nel conto, difficoltà a gestire i totali serali e mensili, lentezza nel prendere gli ordini, errori nel comunicare comande in cucina, difficoltà a doppiare la comanda in modo da mandarla al bar e alla cassa
